# Hi, I'm Aniket Karkhelikar

AI/ML Engineering Student @ VIT Bhopal

## About Me

I am an AI/ML Engineering student exploring the intersection of advanced mathematics and massive compute. I build production-ready systems. I am selective about where I apply my energy. I prioritize visionary projects with a clear core purpose and a strong "why". 

**Currently working on:** STEALTH

**Currently learning:** Deep Neural Networks & Transformer Architectures (following Andrej Karpathy's curriculum).

**Deep dive:** Developed scalable RAG pipelines using Ray and Qdrant for distributed computing.

**Infrastructure:** I also engineer the DevOps side of AI—setting up secure tunnels (ZeroTier/Twingate) and managing Dockerized environments.  Can't remember specifics because that's something that's solved when the problem comes, but can deploy it.

**Reading:** Philosophy and biographies.

## Featured Projects

### [Web Master Terminal](https://github.com/aniketkarkhelikar/web_terminal)
**Centralized Remote Terminal Controller** | `Node.js` `Socket.io` `xterm.js` `Express`

- Built a centralized web interface to control multiple remote PCs/servers via a browser-based terminal. 
- Implemented a Master-Agent architecture using Socket. io for real-time, low-latency bidirectional communication.  
- Features include dynamic PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) generation using node-pty and automatic agent discovery.  

---

### [Bharat FoodTrace](https://github.com/aniketkarkhelikar/bharat-foodtrace)
**Blockchain-based Food Supply Chain Traceability** | `Solidity` `Smart Contracts` `React` `Web3`

- End-to-end supply chain tracking using the Ethereum blockchain to ensure food safety transparency.
- Full-stack implementation with verifiable smart contracts.
- Pending real-world industry insights for next phase of development. 

---

### [Distributed RAG Pipeline](https://github.com/aniketkarkhelikar/rag_tests) PRIVATE
**Scalable Retrieval Systems** | `Ray` `Qdrant` `LangChain`

- Advanced experiments in Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- Implemented distributed indexing using Ray to handle large-scale document processing; scales horizontally to maintain latency even with data doubling. 
- Initial logic used for the NCIIPC AI Grand Challenge entry. 

---

### [Attention Is All You Need](https://github.com/aniketkarkhelikar/attention-is-all-u-need)
**GPT-2 Implementation from Scratch** | `PyTorch` `Transformers` `NLP`

- Building GPT-2 architecture from the ground up (following [Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)).
- Targeting completion by April, culminating in training a 124M parameter model from scratch.  

---

### [Inbox Annihilator](https://github.com/Nikh-on-Linux/inbox-annihilator)
**Intelligent Email Management System** | `Python` `Gmail API` `IMAP`

- "MakeMailsGreatAgain" – because manual inbox zero is impossible. 

---

### [3D Simulation Suite](https://github.com/aniketkarkhelikar/Discrete_assignment)
**Interactive Mathematical Modeling** | `Python` `Jupyter` `3D Graphics`

- Visualizing discrete math concepts through continuously rotating 3D cube simulations. 
- Bridging the gap between mathematical theory and graphical rendering.
